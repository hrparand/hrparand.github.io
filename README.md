### Branches  
  ## [C:](https://github.com/hrparand/hrparand.github.io/tree/C)  
    Here you can see my journey through Harvard X's **CS50 Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
    The projects that I particularly enjoyed were caesar.c in which a simple ciphertext is generated, and runoff.c an   algorithm for determining the winner of a ranked-choice voting system elections.
  ## [Python:](https://github.com/hrparand/hrparand.github.io/tree/Python)  
    Here are the practice projects I have done as a part of Harvardx's **CS50 Introduction to Programming with python**.  
  ## [R:](https://github.com/hrparand/hrparand.github.io/tree/R)  
    Here you can see the final project I did for the **Statistical Analysis with R** course, offered by Charite's BSPH.
